# Logis Website

Faced many challenges. Below are either not completed and what are the challenges we faced which noted for to avoid in future.

1. Structuring Layout ... Always put container div for all sections. here some div require full width so i removed but its a must.
2. I have developed each sections separately in individual files. so while combing all of them in a single index file i faced challenges in x axis padding. some sections are having enough space say 2rem or 3rem but by default i gave 1 rem in all sections to avoid any space challenges when compare in original bootstrap template.
3.  Still Navigatin menu bar is pending a sidebar functionality.
4.  Need to hanlde responsive but i ignored that due to , Need to design first for the 1440p screen then we will minimize and accomodate more screens later on .
5.  also this template contains shadow like text in all section heading which is difficult to implement. So i ignore that. if finds time iwill complete that.
6.  About us section contains a video play button which opens in current iframe window but my code will open in new tab. This is challenged one but will complete later on.
7.  FAQ section accordion open functionality is so smooth but my code just opens ... So try to implement open smooth detail window .
8.  Maximum i used grid functionality instead of flex to prove my knowledge on grid. A good learning. Maximise using grid for better control on layout.
